Support Vector Machine is a machine learning model that makes use of an L2 hinge loss function to optimize a linear classification model. It's best described by it's loss function, which seeks to create a margin between the score it gives to the correct label, and the score it gives to the other incorrect labels.

$$\large L_i = \sum_{j \neq y} max(0, s_j - s_{y_i} + \Delta)$$

The loss function can be described as the sum of differences between the prediction score given to the wrong class ($s_j$) and the prediction score of the correct class($s_{y_i}$), only if the prediction score of the wrong class was higher by a defined margin($\Delta$). The cost function wants all the scores assigned to the wrong class to be lower than the correct class by $\Delta$. The fact that we only care about differences greater than zero (max function) makes this a hinge loss function. 

Alternatives are squared hinge loss ($\max(0, -)^2$) which would penalize a boundary that allows data points to cross the margin more strongly. 

## Regularization
If there is a transformation $f(x_i) = W_ix_i + b $ where the prediction $ f(x_i) $ scores correctly (therefore generating zero loss), then any scaling of $W$ would yield the same loss of zero. This can cause the weights to explode to large numbers, so we want to penalize overly large weights. 

This technique also prevents overfitting, where the model may begin to favor a specific feature and begin maxing out a specific weight over all others. Adding this L2 regularization improves generalization of the model. 

$$\large R(W) = \lambda \sum_{k}\sum_{l}W^2_{k,l}$$
